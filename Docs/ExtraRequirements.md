1. Intuitive and Responsive UI
   1. Our UI should be intuitive to the user and responsive to their actions.
2. Database Persistence and Security
   1. All changes made with the UI that change data should persist within the database. There should be no direct access to the database through the application, as all actions that may edit data should be carefully nested within the UI.
